# Ranking to pageviews

An attempt at extrapolating likely pageview counts based on website rankings in the [CrUX](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/crux) and [Tranco](https://tranco-list.eu/) datasets. Pageview data comes from [analytics.usa.gov](https://analytics.usa.gov/).

| Unranked (100M) |                    |       37,346 |

5M, 10M, 50M, "unranked" 100M values extrapolated based on a power series trend line of `4.49E+12x^-1.01`. RÂ² = 0.988.

Google Sheets formula: `=4.49 * POWER(10 , 12) * A1^(-1.01)`

The above results are based on CrUX ranks only. Tranco ranks results are shared below for reference.

## Methodology

With [DuckDB](https://duckdb.org/):

```sql
create table tranco as select * from './tranco-top-1m.csv';
create table analytics as select * from './top-10000-analytics-30d.csv';
create table crux as select * from './crux-current.csv';
create table mapping as (
  select
    a.hostname,
    crux.origin as crux_origin,
    column1 as tranco_domain,
    a.pageviews,
    a.visits,
    rank as crux_rank,
    column0 as tranco_rank,
  from analytics a
  -- CrUX has full origins including protocol. Analytics data uses domain only.
  join crux on a.hostname = regexp_extract(crux.origin, '^(?:https?:\/\/)?([^\/]+)', 1)
  -- Tranco has a tendency to use root domains even for sites served on www.
  left join tranco on regexp_extract(a.hostname, '^(?:www\.)?(.+)', 1) = tranco.column1
  order by rank asc
);
copy(select * from mapping) to './crux-tranco-analytics-mapping.csv';
```

## Tranco full results

TODO: describe results and pitfalls.

```sql
copy (
  select
      tranco_domain,
      tranco_rank,
      cast(round(pageviews * 365.0 / 30.0) as bigint) as pageviews_365,
      crux_rank
  from
      mapping
  where
    tranco_rank not null
  order by
      tranco_rank
) to './tranco-pageviews.csv';
```

## Caveats

- CrUX ranks origins (including protocol and full), while Tranco ranks hostnames.
- Only 650 data points are available, 80% of which are for the 500k/1M ranks.
- The date ranges differ, so the site traffic reflected in the ranks and page views are for different time periods.
- The pageviews dataset is for websites primarily intended for a USA audience, while the rankings are global.
- Yearly pageview data is extrapolated from a specific 30-day period so will show seasonal patterns relevant for North America.
- There is no data for CrUX ranks above 1M (5M, 10M, 50M).

## Get the data

```bash
# Manually get tranco data from https://tranco-list.eu/.
wget https://analytics.usa.gov/data/live/top-10000-domains-30-days.csv
grep -E 'hostname,pageviews,visits|\.gov|\.mil' top-10000-domains-30-days.csv > top-10000-analytics-30d.csv
rm top-10000-domains-30-days.csv
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zakird/crux-top-lists/main/data/global/current.csv.gz
extract current.csv.gz
mv current.csv crux-current.csv
```
